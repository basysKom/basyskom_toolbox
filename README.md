# basysKom Toolbox

## Goals

- Improve the quality of the software we create through technical/organisational measures
- Good defaults for our projects
- Conscious decisions to make use of certain techniques at the start of the project (when there is still time)
- Knowledge transfer within the basysKom team and with our customers
- Provide a tools teams, developers and project managers can pick from

## Non-goals
- The goal is **NOT** to construct a heavy-weight process to be applied to all projects in a one-size-fits-all manner.

## What is a tool?
In this context, a tool is a small recipe for achieving a particular **goal**. It gives hints on how to **implement** a tool and on the potential **effort** to do so. In which situation can a tool be **usefully applied**? It outlines **caveats** and **limitations**. The idea is loosely inspired by the classic book "Design Patterns". 

A tool is not set in stone. We expect feedback from users of a tool about it's usefulness, effort, caveats and limitations. Please post issues about a specific tool directly on github.

An important piece of information for a given tool is the **applicability**. A particular tool might be very easy to implement in a greenfield project, but not in a legacy code base. Another tool might make perfect sense for developing a large application, but not for a three-week prototype.
