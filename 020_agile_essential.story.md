# A story describes what needs to be done

## Goals

Structured way to describe what needs to be done.

## Description

A story is the most important artifact in an agile workflow.

 These are my ACCEPTANCE CRITERIAS.

A good story is independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, short, precise, testable and fits on a small piece of paper.
