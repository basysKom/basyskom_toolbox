# A Definition of Ready defines when a story is ready to get estimated

## Goals

Ensure that a working task is undestood by your team

## Description

A Definition Of Ready contains all requirements that a product owner (who writes the story) needs to fulfill, so that the team says 

*"Yep, now we got it."*

**A Definition of Ready describes when a Story is Ready for a sprint.**

Ususally a defintion of ready answers the why, the what and finally the how.

 - Is the goal of the story clear enough?
 - Is the value for the project clear?
 - Is the expected result undestood?
 - Are the acceptance criteria for the story clear?

Once the product owner has written a story that can answer those questions, the team can answer these:

 - Is the story small enough the get done in one sprint?
 - The team knows how the story can be implemented!
 - The story is estimated!
 
 In other words, a *Definition of Ready* describes what need to be fullfiled by a story so that this story is **Clear**, **Testable**, **Implementable**.
