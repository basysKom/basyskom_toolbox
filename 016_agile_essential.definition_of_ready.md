# A Definition of Ready defines when a story is ready to get estimated

## Goals

Ensure that a working task is understood by your team

## Description

A Definition of Ready contains all requirements that a Product Owner (the one who writes the story) needs to fulfill, so that the team says:

*"Yep, now we got it."*

**A Definition of Ready describes when a Story is ready for a sprint.**

Usually a Definition of Ready answers the *why*, the *what* and finally the *how*.

- Is the goal of the story clear enough?
- Is the value for the project clear?
- Is the expected result understood?
- Are the acceptance criteria for the story clear?

Once the Product Owner has written a story that can answer those questions, the team can answer these:

- Is the story small enough the get done in one sprint?
- The team knows how the story can be implemented!
- The story is estimated!

In other words, a *Definition of Ready* describes what need to be fulfilled by a story so that this story is **Clear**, **Testable**, **Implementable**.
