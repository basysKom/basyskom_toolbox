# A short daily call allows you to track progress on a daily basis

## Goals

Make sure everyone in your interdisciplinary team knows what everyone else is working on.

## Description

A short 15 minute daily call improves the performance, efficiency and interdisciplinary understanding of your teams.

You will have to make sure that this call is moderated and that technical discussions are kept to a minimum.

Everyone will only answer three questions.

- What have you done since last daily?
- What are you going to do today?
- Do you have any immediate issues?

In complex situations you can change the way of asking. First everyone answers what has been done yesterday, then the team can plan together what needs to be done today.
