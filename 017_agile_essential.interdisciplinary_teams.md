# An agile team is an interdisciplinary team

Build highperforming teams

## Description

Traditionally teams are split along professions rather than their relation to each other.Â Our experience is that in order to create high performing teams, you have to bring all disciplines together into one SCRUM team.

## Environment

Agile Projects

## Platform

All

## Implementation effort

Depending on the current situation this requires coaching

## Applicability

New projects. But can be applied to entire organisations.

## Caveats

Sometimes it is complicated to break up known structures and workflows.
