# An agile team is an interdisciplinary team

## Goals

Build a high performing team

## Description

Traditionally, teams are split along professions rather than their relation to each other.Â In order to create high performing teams, you have to bring all disciplines together into one SCRUM team. A SCRUM team is responsible to deliver a sprint, increment and release. Such a team is roughly 3-7 people in size; they are self-organized, self-contained and they can make decisions for themselves. No individual from outside the team, whether it be a stakeholder, the Product Owner, or the Scrum Master, should dictate to the team how a story is to be implemented. It is imperative that the team assumes full responsibility for meeting the acceptance criteria and adhering to the definition of done. (***Our experience is:** A team that can technical decide upon their experience is faster, happier and delivers higher quality. Or in other words, self-organisation is a core principle of SCRUM.*)

It is important that a SCRUM team is stable, changing the team will reduce the performance and to be expected quality of the results.

How you can figure out if your team is an interdisciplinary, self contained team? Here are some checkpoints:

- They have all the competences to implement the backlog - there is no *"we have to wait for department # to finalize this."*
- They can decide what they can deliver within the next sprint
- They are self-organized
- They are working closely together with the Product Owner
- They can estimate the vision and stories
